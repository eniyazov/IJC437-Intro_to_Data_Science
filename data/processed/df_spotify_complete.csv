Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend

Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized

Stretch Armstrong, yeah

Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars on my arm

Bell-bottoms and eight-track tapes

Did she decline? No

What was the deal? A pretty girl, age twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears

Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?

So how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way

Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin' dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin' dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin' them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

It's over, over

And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship
Gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart, but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right

Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time (yeah)
And I gave you my all (yo)
Now baby be mine

Oh I, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be coming home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checking for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine

Always there when you call
Always on time
Gave you my
Baby be mine
Always there when you call
Always on time
Gave you my
Baby be mine

That they can't have my love no more

He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

Watching the people as they pass

Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files

I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

Body-Body-Body-Body like heaven

Uh-huh, come on
You can say I'm plain Jane but it's not the same
I ain't into big names but I like nice things
I watch boxin' matches and the football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress but I love to sing
I like goin' out, takin' walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home and curl up next to ya
Though I'm ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm havin' sex with ya

Anywhere I go I'm spotted
(Fo' real and that's no question)
And anything I want I got it
(No frontin' and no guessin')
5' 5"" with brown eyes

Smile like the sunrise

Baby, look me in the eyes and tell me yeah
I'm the kind of girl you like, I'm feelin' you
'Cause sweetie you're my kind of guy, that's what it is
Think about it you just might wanna run with this
All night long and if you want me, we can keep this going
But let me tell you I'm the type that's strong
And I don't trust a lot of men, I'm independent
I ain't like some other women

Ven aqui, Ven aqui Mama
Baby girl don't you know you're a star
We could take a little trip to mi casa
Spend the night popping cris in the hot tub
See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5' brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile its got me hypnotized

Mira (So can I get your number?)
Mi amor me ama bien
Te encantara si quisieras lo tendras
(I don't know what you said, but I like it)
Dondequiera, soy notada
Lo que que me hayo me consigo
Y morena, ojos negros

I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you

I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this

No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her had she seen my baby
(Oh I) Drove my six around, looking for that missing lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused

And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa)
Hm, something's going on upstairs, yeah
Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah (Bump bump bump)
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming out

""You're contagious, touch me baby
Give me what you got"" (Then a man said)
""Sexy lady (Ooh) drive me crazy
Drive me wild"" (All I heard was my baby's voice screaming)
""You're contagious, touch me baby (Touch me)

Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah)

A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret (Oh)
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes, sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers

The game's been a wrap, one
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me

You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table

Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti

I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine

Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say
You might also like
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away the
Anger of angels who won't return
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you
And I don't know why

And I don't know why

Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix

Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (Oh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Alright (Can you fill me in?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You were standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)
You might also like
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door""
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, whose property?
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
(Craig David)
Watchin' our every move
Think someday they might approve, baby

No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Hoe, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?

With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani

Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops

Yeah, so I wish for you on a bright shining star

And now I look to the sky for a better day
To the beat, y'all, and Scooby Snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Never had to be on a movie screen
Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams, come on

Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are

Made a CD and then he hit the block

Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me

At sunrise I fight to stay asleep

'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same

To let love replace all our hate

I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote ""Call for a good time""
And I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?!

How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio
How do you like me now?!

When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home
And you’re always alone

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death

'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

When we hooked up
We sat down, made an agreement
We vowed that, that we'd always
Be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never, ever leave us
That was awhile ago
But now lately it feels like, I mean, I feel like
All we do is fight every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back and take it way back
All the way back, can we start again?
Do it over, can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?

Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces (I'm searching for)

To let you know you're my baby
And even when then they say we won't stay around
If they only knew that we were meant to be together
Forever and ever, whatever, there's no better thing

Love is nothin' but the time it takes to say, ""I'm on your mind""
Let me tell you, I'm always there, oh, yeah

Meet me at the finish line so I can tell you one more time

And now he's a boss and you listen when his voice speaks

I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

I wish, I wish, I wish
(Every hood)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(And every block)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America!)

Rolling through the hood, just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know that your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed, going on four long years
I'm still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days you used to talk to me
Smiling while I'm sipping on this Hennessy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish
You might also like
I wish that I could hold you now

Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come, ut's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, ""Boy, you've been blessed""
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shooting this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass players get a real player hating 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends

Your family called the morning of a tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies land
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing

(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday

Instead of you all throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

One thing, I don't know why

To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

Given her an extra key?

She never took her eyes off me

How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play

Never admit to a word weh she say

Extortion or maybe Grand Larceny

By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

Love , callin' your name, put your phone in the Range

Time to know ya - that's a good chick
Before it's all over, I'ma meat this chick
Probably treat this chick, mo' betta
Cause if you ain't - know, thugs and ladies go together
Poppin' my collar, patnah - who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot; and the mug and the watch ugly
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they don't trust me
And they say I'm lucky; you think I got time
To blow all this dough and do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama chargin white Rolls

I wanna, feel your passion, come when you askin'
Laugh when you cryin', cry when you laughin
But ain't nothing happenin', a girl got a little uptight
Turned off the light and then started crashin'
The radio blastin' ""Between Me and You""
But, you ain't on the low with that freaky thing you do

A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and we knew
We couldn't rush but

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the
Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
On you I can depend, yeah, yeah
Love of my life
Without you, baby
Feels like I sampled true love, yeah
But the shit didn’t clear
Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
On you I can depend, yeah
Love of my life
Without you, baby
Feels like I sampled true love, yeah
But the shit didn’t clear

Y'all know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
To get her back I had to sweat her
Thought she roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Them boys may be better, to grow I had to let her (Never)
She needed cheddar and I understood that (That)
Lookin' for cheese, that don't make her a hoodrat (Rat)
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me
I love it when she sings to me
It's like that and a
Love of my life
Ooh, you know you rock my world and
Love of my life
You be boy and I'll be girl and
Love of my life
We don't stop until the break of dawn, ooh
Love of my life

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct

Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow

Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather

Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?

Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today...

Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished for one more day with you

One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day

First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone and keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do with one more day with you

One more day, one more time

And I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the otherside

Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
A stranger thing could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside

Take it on the otherside

Oh you didn't think we could do it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimpin' to Poppin' Tags
From Champions to Slow Jammin', oh baby

Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right?

Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right?
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life

And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you pose taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed

I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I was off to drink you away (Drink you away)

Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling
""I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there""

Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my

Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town

Telling me about a party up in NYC

Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no

And this the things I get shorty?

I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home

89,Sing for the Moment,Eminem,/wiki/Sing_for_the_Moment,Sing for the Moment,/wiki/Eminem,2003,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can—
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)

They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy, she said, ""See you later, boy""

She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?

Mothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night
Between fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right

Have you ever seen crocodile seats in the truck
Turn around and sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steerin' wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma, player's where you can find me
Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me 'cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went ""uh-uh"", and all of a sudden
Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom) from the amplifiers
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits

Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man, I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flyin' in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive, I stay shive
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent

You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoe
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell
So what could it be?
Is there someone imitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong

Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player
But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady on the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life

Three days before we had to be back
When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore
Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life
His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

You worked nights on end

So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
Of a corner bar, and it just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
But he walked up, and said, ""What'll it be?""
I said, ""The good stuff""

He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said ""You can't find that here""

'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""
You might also like
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying, ""I'm a Grandpa""
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He said, ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says, ""I'm sorry,"" say, ""So am I""
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up

And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically, I'm through with you
Whatcha wanna say, had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay

There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
You might also like
Please don't come around talking about how you changed
How you said good-bye to what's her name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you
Had to get myself from 'round you, because my life was all about you

So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah, it's like that
Had your chance, won't take you back
Now what, what you think about that?
And when I say I'm through, I'm through

Oh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time
Don't you wish you still were mine?
Don't you wish I'd take you back?
Don't you wish that things were simple like that, oh?
Didn't miss a good thing 'til it's gone
But I knew it wouldn't be long, till you came running back
Missing my love, there you go

There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go

61,Through the Wire,Kanye West,/wiki/Through_the_Wire,Through the Wire,/wiki/Kanye_West,2004,"Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

Yo, G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid **** that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin

Och den finaste tjejen från skolan går nu på tjack
Och fler och fler omkring mig åker fast, de är locked
Och när mamma säger ""Varför ska du ut nu inatt?""
Ännu en nittonåring borta, ännu en broder som slockna
Jag har fler döda vänner än fingrar på min hand

Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and this nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done

Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied

I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
You might also like
When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies, say, ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about (Look at yourself)
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)
You got it bad

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track

Makin' plans for life

We can walk through tha mall while I hold ya hips
Or you can hang out tha drop while I'm pushin' tha whip
Take you on a ride, you will never forget
Runnin' home, tellin' your friends lil' Fizz is it
Got ya hooked by tha way that I lick my lips

Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

In the sweetest dreams

Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better

It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh-oh

Waiting for tonight

Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never

We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate

But that crossed my mind a little too late

There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing

They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five or six strippers tryna work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry?
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life
Mmm

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be livin' all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die

In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK

Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?

With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love

Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God

Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

And go on with the struggle
Tryin' to be someone else, why should I pretend
That I like the mood I'm in?

Day to day the roads we play, walkin' round with frowns on our face
When we wanna be happy
Never being true to self, once you're gone there's nothin' left
But a breeze, wanting to be free

Why, why can't they just let me be?
And why, why can't I just be free?
Without them telling me, where to go, what to say, who to see
And why, why can't I just be free?

How many ways have I tried to be like someone else
But couldn't fit the profile
Dancin' a dance, knowing that I'm off beat all the while
But I didn't believe

When you sing to me

All the while you were in front of me I never realized
I jus' can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it, I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it
When you sing to me
How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it, I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it

91,You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This,Toby Keith,/wiki/You_Shouldn%27t_Kiss_Me_Like_This,You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This,/wiki/Toby_Keith,2001,"I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know
You might also like
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again2Embed",spotify:track:5taqvRgn1DdZ117p2DhPXQ,0.439,0.665,7,-7.671,1,0.0351,0.474,1.56e-5,0.26,0.328,168.707,audio_features,5taqvRgn1DdZ117p2DhPXQ,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5taqvRgn1DdZ117p2DhPXQ,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/5taqvRgn1DdZ117p2DhPXQ,223467,4
48,Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,/wiki/Your_Body_Is_a_Wonderland,Your Body Is a Wonderland,/wiki/John_Mayer,2003,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You might also like
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)

Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands)21Embed",spotify:track:7vFv0yFGMJW3qVXbAd9BK9,0.647,0.729,5,-6.251,1,0.0236,0.0206,0.0489,0.134,0.687,94.01,audio_features,7vFv0yFGMJW3qVXbAd9BK9,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7vFv0yFGMJW3qVXbAd9BK9,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/7vFv0yFGMJW3qVXbAd9BK9,249627,4
